# markdown_book_test

This repo is used in conjunction with [Twist](https://github.com/radar/twist-v2) to test its functionality. 

Do not use this as an example of how to setup a Leanpub book on GitHub. For that, you should instead refer to [Leanpub's documentation](https://leanpub.com/help/getting_started_sync_github).
